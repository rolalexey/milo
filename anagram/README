data/   contains two dictionaries    full webster-dictionary.txt (300000 real words)
        and  webster-small.txt  (~20000 words)

        program skip separated by ' ' and '-' multiwords

        webster-small.txt is quite enough to test
        anagram chain derived from 'ail' start word.

        anagram search run in separate thread leaving UI unblocked.
